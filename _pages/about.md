I am a PhD candidate at UC San Diego interested working with low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (ultracool dwarfs, UCDs). UCDs are the lowest-mass objects (M<0.1 Msun) in the Milky Way, classified into spectral types M, L and T dwarfs. My research focuses on Galactic Archeology with UCDs, which involves measuring (or inferring) their scaleheight, age and mass distribution throughout the Galaxy. To accomplish this, I look for distant (~1 kpc) UCDs in deep surveys, namely the WISPS & 3D-HST surveys and run Monte-Carlo simulations including input distributions: initial mass function, star formation history, multiplicity statistics, Galactic structure and UCD evolutionary models to predict their number counts in these deep fields. 

# Finding UCDs in the WISPS & 3D-HST Surveys using Machine Learning vs Traditional Methods

WISPS and 3D-HST (Atek et al. 2010, Momcheva at al. 2016, Skelton et al. 2014) use HST/WFC3 (Kimble et al. 2008)  to obtain photometry and low-resolution (R≈130) near-infrared spectra of more than 250,000 sources. These surveys were designed to measure star-formation in high redshift galaxies (z>2) by measuring red shifted emission lines. The observations are taken in “parallel” mode, meaning that WFC3 operates concurrently with another instrument, allowing pointings in multiple directions, primarily at high Galactic latitudes (|b| ≥ 20 deg).
