I am a PhD candidate at UC San Diego interested working with low-mass stars and brown dwarfs (ultracool dwarfs, UCDs). UCDs are the lowest-mass objects (M<0.1 Msun) in the Milky Way, classified into spectral types M, L and T dwarfs. My research focuses on Galactic Archeology with UCDs, which involves measuring (or inferring) their scaleheight, age and mass distribution throughout the Galaxy. To accomplish this, I look for distant (~1 kpc) UCDs in deep surveys, namely the WISPS & 3D-HST surveys and run Monte-Carlo simulations including input distributions: initial mass function, star formation history, multiplicity statistics, Galactic structure and UCD evolutionary models to predict their number counts in these deep fields.
